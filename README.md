AIDAO 2024 track 2 solution<br />
This was the solution my team wasn't able to upload.<br />
Original problem is stated here: https://github.com/atolstikov/aidao24/tree/main/qualifiers_track_2<br />
Brain data was processed to connectivity matrix, classifier has a classic CNN architecture.<br />
Due to the lack of data only 12 elements of initial data were used as validation. Accuracy on validation after only four epochs got to 1.
